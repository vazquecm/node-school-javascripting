// ## REVISING STRINGS (Exercise 5 of 19)

//   You will often need to change the contents of a string.

//   Strings have built-in functionality that allow you to inspect and
//   manipulate their contents.

var pizza = 'pizza is alright';
	pizza = pizza.replace('alright', 'wonderful');
	console.log(pizza);
