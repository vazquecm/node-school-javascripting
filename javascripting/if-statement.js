// ## IF STATEMENT (Exercise 9 of 19)

//   Conditional statements are used to alter the control flow of a program,
//   based on a specified boolean condition.

// ## The challenge:

//   Create a file named if-statement.js.

//   In that file, declare a variable named fruit.

//   Make the fruit variable reference the value orange with the type of
//   String.

//   Then use console.log() to print "The fruit name has more than five
//   characters." if the length of the value of fruit is greater than five.
//   Otherwise, print "The fruit name has five characters or less."

var fruit = 'orange';

	if (fruit.length > 5) {
		console.log('The fruit name has more than five characters.');
		} else {
			console.log('The fruit name has five characters or less.');
		}
