// ## FOR LOOP (Exercise 10 of 19)

//   For loops look like this:

//      for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
//        // log the numbers 0 through 9
//        console.log(i)
//      }

//   The variable i is used to track how many times the loop has run.

//   The statement i < 10; indicates the limit of the loop. It will continue to loop if i is less than 10.

//   The statement i++ increases the variable i by 1 each loop.

//  ## The challenge:

//   In that file define a variable named total and make it equal the number 0.

//   Define a second variable named limit and make it equal the number 10.

//   Create a for loop with a variable i starting at 0 and increasing by 1 each time through the loop. The loop should run as long as i is less than
//   limit.


var total = 0;
var limit = 10;

  for (var i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
    total += i;
  }
    console.log(total)
